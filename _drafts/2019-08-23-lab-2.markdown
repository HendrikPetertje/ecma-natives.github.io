# Lab 2: Stay Classy

This lab is the second in a series of three labs where we don't build anything
awesome yet, but instead look at some of the fundamental building blocks of the
language. Last week you did a lot of things with the different simple object
types in JavaScript and next week we'll cover some basic Test Driven Development
(aka TDD). This week however we're going to dive into "Classes"!
We'll also cover some functions, pure-functions and simple objects.

Classes, functions and objects are among the basic building blocks for a lot of
new (web) applications. Modern frameworks like Vue and React rely heavy on them,
so this lab is going to among the most important labs so far!

Enough introduction let's begin from the beginning.

## What is a class

It's good to know what this very particular tool in our tool-belt does before we
start using it.

![What does it do?](https://i.imgur.com/SszghQ5.png)

To explain classes I'm going to borrow the description Oracle gives on classes
in their [classes section on programming concepts][oracle on classes].

> In the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same
> kind. There may be thousands of bicycles in existence, all of the same
> make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and
> therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that
> your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. A class
> is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

So a bike in JavaScript would look a bit like this (you don't have to write this
yet):

```javascript
class Bike {
  type;
  colour;
  wheelCount = 2;
  speed = 0;

  constructor(type, colour, wheelCount) {
    this.type = type;
    this.colour = colour;
    this.wheelCount = wheelCount;
  }

  increaseSpeed(difference) {
    this.speed += difference;
    return this.speed;
  }

  decreaseSpeed(difference) {
    this.speed -= difference;
    return this.speed;
  }
}
```

_Just 2 wheels?_

When we want to "build" a new instance of a bike we simply perform
something among the lines of:

```javascript
> bike = new Bike('mountainbike', 'red')
> bike.increaseSpeed(10)
10
```

## A "real" project

Let's start writing some code ourselves. Until now you've written code in a
single file, then executing that code. We're going to do things a bit different
now. When working with classes, components, modules and other patterns of
programming it's quite common to put different subjects in different files and
call for them when needed.

So we're going to build a project now. Let's begin at the beginning.
Open a new terminal window on your machine. We're going to assume that you have
Nodenv with a working version of NodeJS installed (you did this in previous
labs).

`cd` to the folder where you keep your projects & code snippets and create a new
folder like so:

```sh
$ mkdir classes_app
$ cd classes_app
```

In this folder we are going to "intialize" a new NodeJS project like this:

```sh
$ npm init
```

When you run that command it will ask you some questions. Fill them in like
this:

```
package name: (classes_app)
version: (1.0.0) 0.0.1
description: ecma natives classes app
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)

Is this OK? (yes)
```

The values between `(` and `)` are default values. You only have to fill in
`version` and `description`, you can just hit [ENTER] on the rest of the
questions.

When done, try to execute `ls` to see the new file added to your project. The
`package.json` file that just popped up contains the basic information about
your project and its dependencies. We'll open it up later. First we need take
care of some `eslint` grammar rules for our project.

![ESLint](https://media1.giphy.com/media/xVRjhzurfBoAaGvy4D/giphy.gif)
_ESLint introduces (code) grammar and spelling checks to our project_

Execute the following command to install ESLint on your entire machine. We'll
need this in a bit to create a local configuration later.

```sh
$ npm install -g eslint
$ nodenv rehash
```

The `-g` command tells the terminal to install a plug-in globally on the machine
in the folder `~/.nodenv/versions/x/lib/node_modules`. This way the plug-in you
install will be available to the entire system. The plug-in will however not
follow along when you share your project with others on sites like GitHub.

When you leave the `-g` out, the plug-in will instead install in your project's
`package.json` and its `../your-project/node_modules`. But we'll let the global
plug-in take care of that in a bit.

> The `nodenv rehash` bit refreshes the list of commands that can be run using
> node. Eslint added some commands to our terminal that we need.

The next step is the "project-only" installation of ESLint and the setup of the
Grammer- and spelling-dialect we want to use (we call the combination of this
grammar and spelling "style-rules").

```sh
$ eslint --init
```

ESLint will go through some questions with you. Use the Arrow keys on your
keyboard to select the following options (in some cases you also need Space-bar):

```
? How would you like to use ESLint? (Use arrow keys)
(3) ❯ To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style

? What type of modules does your project use?
(2) ❯ CommonJS (require/exports)

? Which framework does your project use?
(3) ❯ None of these

? Where does your code run?
◯ Browser (un-select with space-bar)
◉ Node (select with space-bar)

? How would you like to define a style for your project?
(1) ❯ Use a popular style guide

? Which style guide do you want to follow?
(1) ❯ Airbnb (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

? What format do you want your config file to be in?
(1) ❯ JavaScript

? Would you like to install them now with npm? Y (Type "Y" and hit ENTER)
```

If you make a mistake, just hit `<CTRL>` + `<C>` on your keyboard and rerun
`eslint --init`

When you're done and run `ls -a` you'll see four things in your project:

- `.eslintrc.js` - A file with the ESLint "grammar dialect" (aka style-rules)
  we are going to use.
- `node_modules/` - A folder where all project plugins are installed.
- `package-lock.json` - A file specifying the locked versions of your
  dependencies.
- `package.json` - your project configuration.

Let's open our project in Atom and load our `package.json` file (don't forget
the `.`.):

```sh
$ atom .
```

It should look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "classes_app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "ecma natives classes app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^6.2.1",
    "eslint-config-airbnb-base": "^14.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.18.2"
  }
}
```

Let's replace the test line to easily run an `index.js` file later:

```json
{
  "name": "classes_app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "ecma natives classes app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "app": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^6.2.1",
    "eslint-config-airbnb-base": "^14.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.18.2"
  }
}
```

Good! Now that we are talking about an `index.js` file, we probably want to
create that file. Go back to your terminal and execute:

```
$ touch index.js
```

Open up the file in atom and write the following code:

```
console.log('test');
```

If everything in the editor is working as expected, you should be seeing the
following (when mouse/cursor-hovering over the `console.log` line):

Neat, our linter is telling us we are using code that should probably not be
there when we release stuff to the internet later!

Congratulations, you have now probably spent 15 minutes on something entirely
different than classes!

## Let's write a class

We create a new file in our project called `book.js` (you can do that in Atom
or use the `touch book.js` command like before in your terminal). This `book.js`
needs to sit in the same project folder as your `package.json` and `index.js`

In this `book.js` we'll write the following code:

```javascript
class Book {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
    this.sorting = title.charAt(0); // first character of our title
  }
}

module.exports = Book;
```

Let's go over this code line by line:

### `class Book`

Sets the name of our new class. Like a `const` a Class can't be re-assigned to
something else. It's probably good to mention regular naming of things in
javascript now:

- Classes always begin with uppercase and then CamelCase. A `mountain-bike`
  class should therefore be named `MountainBike`. Classes are also often
  singular as a new instance of a class often represents _one_ object with
  properties and functions.
- Normal variables begin with lower-case and continue CamelCase. So a regular
  non-class mountain-bike would be named `mountainBike` (the B is our camels)
- File-names use underscores. So the file-name for the `MountainBike` class
  should be `mountain_bike.js`.

### `constructor(title)`

A constructor is one of the features that sets a class in JavaScript apart from
function objects. When you call `new Book('Gardening')` later, JavaScript will
create a new "instance" -- a unique new product from the blueprint that is a
class -- and run the constructor first.

### `this.title = title`

In our constructor we assign the `title` given when we created the class to the
`this` object. `this` is the current state of the object around that line of
code. In this case that is the new instance of our Book.

### `module.exports = Book`

In `module.exports` we define what parts of the code are "exported" from our
JavaScript `book.js` file. These exported bits can be imported by other
JavaScript files. This is super nice as you can sort what other files should
have access too in your JavaScript files and what things should be private.
You normally assign either a single variable (`Book` in this case) or an `{}`
to your `module.exports`

## Importing and using a class

Now that we've written a simple book class it's time to start using it!
Open up your `index.js` in Atom, remove all code you had in it (if there was
code in there) and write (ignore the `console` linting errors):

```es6
const Book = require('./book');

const book = new Book('gardening');
console.log('Book:', book);
console.log('title:', book.title);

const secondBook = new Book('cooking');
console.log('Second Book:', secondBook);
console.log('Second title:', secondBook.title);
```

Now instead of running `node index.js`, we can now run an easier command (one
that we set in our package.json earlier) like this:

```sh
$ npm run app

Book: Book { title: 'gardening', sorting: 'g' }
title: gardening
Second Book: Book { title: 'cooking', sorting: 'c' }
Second title: cooking
```

Now this is neat huh? Let's go over the different lines of code we wrote!

### `const Book = require('./book')`

In this first line we import the book class we exported earlier and put it in
the variable `Book`.

### `new Book('gardening')`

Here we create a new "instance" of a book where `'gardening'` is the first
argument we send to it's constructor.

### `book.title`

Since we have a new instance of a book we can ask for the objects assigned to
its instance. The title being one of them.

## Creating some functions in the class

We've created a class now that can store some information for us. But classes
can do a lot more! Let's write some functions for our class. I'll show you two
methods of doing so.

Open `book.js` and make it look like this:

```javascript
class Book {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
    this.sorting = title.charAt(0); // first character of our title
  }

  logTitle() {
    console.log('book:', this);
    console.log(this.title);
  }

  logTitleAfter(seconds) {
    const miliseconds = seconds * 1000;
    setTimeout(this.logTitle, miliseconds);
  }
}

module.exports = Book;
```

So here we create two functions:

- `logTitle()` which will consol`e.log` the title of our book.
- `logTitleAfter()` which will wait x seconds and then call the `logTitle`
  function (spoiler: nope, this will fail)

Let's incorporate this code in our `index.js` (we're commenting out our old code):

```javascript
const Book = require('./book');

// const book = new Book('gardening');
// console.log('Book:', book);
// console.log('title:', book.title);

// const secondBook = new Book('cooking');
// console.log('Second Book:', secondBook);
// console.log('Second title:', secondBook.title);

const book = new Book('gardening');
book.logTitle();
book.logTitleAfter(2);
```

And then run it:

```sh
$ npm run app
```

Hey something weird is happening!

Our call `book.logTitle();` gave us what we wanted. It logged our book object
and then logged the title.

```javascript
book: Book { title: 'gardening', sorting: 'g' }
gardening
```

But something went wrong with the time-out... all of a sudden the `this` object
isn't our book anymore, but the timeout.

```javascript
book: Timeout {
  _idleTimeout: 2000,
  _idlePrev: null,
  _idleNext: null,
  _idleStart: 30,
  _onTimeout: [Function: logTitle],
  _timerArgs: undefined,
  _repeat: null,
  _destroyed: false,
  [Symbol(refed)]: true,
  [Symbol(asyncId)]: 6,
  [Symbol(triggerId)]: 1
}
undefined
```

So we have switched contexts. To get the book back we can attempt two things.

In older versions of Javascript (up till ECMAScript 3) we'd need to bind stuff
like so:

```javascript
setTimeout(this.logTitle.bind(this), miliseconds);
```

Or create an anonymous (lambda in Python) function (looks messy):

```javascript
const that = this;
setTimeout(function() {
  that.logTitle();
}, miliseconds);
```

In ECMAScript 2015 we got access to so called `arrow-functions`. These
arrow-functions respect the this context around the caller a bit better. Right
now TC-39 is working on getting those arrow functions working in the newest
version of ECMAScript. Let's rewrite our `book.js` a bit until it looks like this:

```javascript
class Book {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
    this.sorting = title.charAt(0); // first character of our title
  }

  // the line below will raise a linter error. that's fine.
  logTitle = () => {
    console.log('book:', this);
    console.log(this.title);
  };

  logTitleAfter(seconds) {
    const miliseconds = seconds * 1000;
    setTimeout(this.logTitle, miliseconds);
  }
}

module.exports = Book;
```

> using arrow-functions as class-functions is extremely new. TC-39 is currently
> working on making browsers & platforms work with it under the ES7
> specifications.
> Your linter is still tuned to ES6, the line will work fine on the terminal.

```sh
$ npm run app
```

Well, the result from that looks much better!

```sh
$ npm run app

book: Book {
  logTitle: [Function: logTitle],
  title: 'gardening',
  sorting: 'g'
}
gardening
book: Book {
  logTitle: [Function: logTitle],
  title: 'gardening',
  sorting: 'g'
}
gardening
```
